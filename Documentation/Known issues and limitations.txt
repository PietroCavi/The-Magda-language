Known issues and limitation of the current version of Magda

1) Cannot be used constant values inside of the ini modules, see the example 
   source code IniExample.magda for further informations.

2) The conventional arithmetic and comparison symbols (eg +, *, <, ...) 
   are fully supported only with the mixin Integer, while for all other 
   mixins is generally necessary to invoke explicit methods (eg, add(), 
   multiply(), less(), ...). 
   More precisely is actually available the support of these symbols
   also with the mixin Boolean, Byte, Float and String in binary expressions 
   but only when at least one of the terms is a constant 
   (eg. floatVariable = 5.7 + floatVariable).
