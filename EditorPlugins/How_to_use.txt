PLUGINS

    In this folder we have 2 very simple plugins that can be used in Vim or VsCode to enable
    a basic syntax highlighting for the Magda programming language. I will briefly cover the
    installation, it will be very easy!

VsCode:

    to enable this simple plugin you will have to copy the folder magda-lang contained in
    the vscode folder present in this directory in the extensions folder of the VsCode
    editor.
    Here are the locations of this folder in Windows, macOS and Linux

        Windows: 
            %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\
        macOS: 
            ~/.vscode/extensions/
        Linux: 
            ~/.vscode/extensions/

Vim:
    
    to enable syntax highlighting in vim for the magda language you will have to copy the
    two folders in the vim folder, so ftdetect and syntax in your vim configuration
    directory, which on a Linux system will be located at:
 
        ~/.vim

    It should be in the same location on macOS as well, I don't really know about windows
    but it's not common to see vim installed on windows.
    If you already have the ftdetect and the syntax directory in your vim configuration
    you can simply copy their contents into your directories with the same name.
