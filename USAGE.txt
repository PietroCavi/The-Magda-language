No installations are needed. In order to use the Magda language simply place
this "mtj" tree in the computer media and call "compile" and "execute" as
explained later.
This Magda language prototype uses Java classes (java 1.5) included inside this "mtj"
package and no specific configurations for Magda are needed; anyway is necessary that the 
pc used contains the Java Sun JDK platform installed and working.

Just as an example main environment variable should be something like:

This Magda milestone is built and checked on a Windows XP based machine.
Maybe is possible to test the language also in other O.S. with little 
modifications at the script level (not available at the moment).

All sample user programs are present (and must be) in the path \mtj\Magda\src\...

To compile a program, from command prompt, type:
  compile ProgramName
Note: ProgramName without extension

Example: to compile the program MagdaTest.magda in \mtj type:
  compile MagdaTest
  
To execute a program, from command prompt, type: 
  execute ProgramName
Note: ProgramName without extension

Example: to execute the program MagdaTest.magda in \mtj type:
  execute MagdaTest

NOTES: Any new program must be created in a folder with the same name of the
       Magda program that contains the 'main' and must be placed inside the
       path: \mtj\Magda\src\...
       With 'main' we intend the method that starts the computation, but this is
       not necessarily called "main", as in Magda does not exist an "official" 
       main method.

       The program folder must contain a sub-folder named 'obj' that needs to
       be created (empty) before compiling.

       All sample user program are present (and must be) in the path \mtj\Magda\src\...
       
       To rebuild the Magda language, if necessary and from command prompt, type:       
         make
