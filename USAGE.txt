No installations are needed. You can just clone this repository, install the dependencies
and you can start tinkering with the language by following this file instructions.

This Magda language prototype uses Java classes included inside this "mtj"
package and no specific configurations for Magda are needed, you will oly need the 
following dependencies:

A JDK for Java 23 (or later, Java is backwards compatible) so that you can use 'javac' to compile
    - It can be istalled with the oracle installer that you can find here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk23-archive-downloads.html
    - Or with your package manager of choice if the package is available

And JavaCC 7.0.12 or later
    - It can be installed by following the official instructions here: https://javacc.github.io/javacc/
    - Or with your package manager of choice if the package is available


This Magda milestone is built and checked on a Linux based machine (Debian 12).
But it has also been tested on a MacBook air M1 with macOS 15 Sequoia and on a
Windows 10 machine.

On Windows 10 there may be a few warning while building the compiler, they are due
to the javacc generated code.

Building or cleaning the project:

To build the project type:
    Windows:
        .\make.bat

    Linux/macOS:
        bash make.bat

To remove all the compiled code
    Windows:
        .\clean.bat

    Linux/macOS:
        bash clean.bat


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

All sample user programs are present (and must be) in the path ./Magda/src/...

To compile a program, from command prompt, type:
    Windows
        .\compile.bat ProgramName
    
    Linux/macOS
        bash compile.bat ProgramName 

Note: ProgramName without extension

Example: to compile the program MagdaTest.magda in the main directory type:
    Windows
        .\compile.bat MagdaTest 
    
    Linux/macOS
        bash compile.bat MagdaTest 
  
To execute a program, from command prompt, type: 
    Windows
        .\execute.bat ProgramName 
    
    Linux/macOS
        bash execute.bat ProgramName 

Note: ProgramName without extension

Example: to execute the program MagdaTest.magda in the main directory type:
    Windows
        .\execute.bat MagdaTest 
    
    Linux/macOS
        bash execute.bat MagdaTest 


-------

NOTES: Any new program must be created in a folder with the same name of the
       Magda program that contains the 'main' and must be placed inside the
       path: ./Magda/src/...

       With 'main' we intend a method called 'mainProgram' contained in a Mixin
       called 'MainClass', this method can't have any parameters!

       The program folder will contain a sub-folder named 'obj', it will be created
       (if not already present), and it will contain the output of the Magda Compiler

       All sample user program are present (and must be) in the path ./Magda/src/...
